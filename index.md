The Emergency Response application is a reference demo that showcases the [Power of Communities]( https://youtu.be/rVtsGZIFw4s ).
The target user of the demo are Red Hat Solution Architects, Consultants and Red Hat Partners.

The Emergency Response application clarifies how the accelerating pace of open-source innovation can be harnessed today in a supported, enterprise manner for your customer's line of business in a hybrid-cloud environment.  Mission critical applications that your customer's business relies on can be built and run on open-source innovation *TODAY*.

The theme for the Emergency Response demo application is inspired by the [volunteer community collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy) that occurred in 2017 during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.  A similar community-driven, collaborative approach was used to develop the demo application and maintain it going forward.

The Emergency Response demo application is a treasure chest of technical insight and best practices.  It entails a micro-service, event driven architecture using the products that comprise Red Hat's [Unified Application Environment](https://developers.redhat.com/appenv).

## Demo Scenario
In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused massive flooding in Southeast Texas, USA. 
The storm left a number of residents stranded and in need of rescue.
Emergency first responders were overwhelmed with the high volume
of rescue calls. A loose-knit group of volunteer boaters assisted in the
rescue effort. These volunteers explored neighborhoods seeking out
residents who needed assistance. In addition, with the support of social
media, a group of volunteers served as dispatchers to relay rescue
requests to the volunteer boaters. This group of volunteers became known
as the [**Cajun Navy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy). The
Cajun Navy has been operating in various forms since Hurricane Katrina
in 2005.

## Demo Solution

The Emergency Response Demo application is inspired by the Cajun Navy response from Hurricane Harvey. 
It provides an online demo that simulates the collaboration between stranded residents and volunteer responders.
In addition, it allows for your audience to participate in this simulation of rescuing their stranded neighbors.
