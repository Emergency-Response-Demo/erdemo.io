<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused massive flooding in Southeast
Texas, USA. The storm left a number of residents stranded and in need of
rescue. Emergency first responders were overwhelmed with the high volume
of rescue calls. A loose-knit group of volunteer boaters assisted in the
rescue effort. These volunteers explored neighborhoods seeking out
residents who needed assistance. In addition, with the support of social
media, a group of volunteers served as dispatchers to relay rescue
requests to the volunteer boaters. This group of volunteers became known
as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy"><strong>Cajun Navy</strong></a>. The
Cajun Navy has been operating in various forms since Hurricane Katrina
in 2005.</p>

<p><img src="images/volunteer-boaters-stock-photo.png" alt="volunteer boaters stock

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>The Emergency Response Demo application is inspired by the Cajun Navy
response from Hurricane Harvey. It provides an online solution to
connect stranded residents with volunteer responders. This application
makes it easy to engage the community to organize volunteer
responders.</p>

<h1 id="application-architecture">Application Architecture</h1>

<p>In this application, you’ll see Red Hat technologies in action and see
how they provide a true hybrid cloud solution, with IT infrastructure
that provides consistency, safety, repeatability, reusability, and
portability while still helping development teams move fast. The
application is based on true polyglot development and it is agile,
secure and scalable at every level in the stack.</p>

<p>Below is a diagram of the application architecture.</p>

<p><img src="/modules/02_App_Overview/images/application-architecture.png" alt="application architecture" /></p>

<h1 id="application-components">Application Components</h1>

<p>The following application components work together to provide the core
implementation for the demo solution.</p>

<h2 id="mission-service">Mission Service</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Vert.x</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Products / Components: JDG, AMQ-Streams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Components: None</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Mission Service exposes an API for managing Missions, including
getting a list of mission keys, getting a specific mission by key,
clearing all missions and getting missions assigned to a specific
responder.</p>

<p>The Mission Service listens on Kafka to the topic-mission-command topic
for details of new or updated missions being created. New Mission
messages trigger a call to MapBox to generate the routes for a mission,
using the responders location as a starting point, the victims location
as a way point and the shelter location as the final destination. The
mission details are then stored in JDG, to service API requests for
Mission details.</p>

<p>The Mission Service sends updates to Kafka on the topic-mission-event
topic in response to mission state change events such as when a mission
is created, when an API request is received (e.g. to complete all
missions). The Mission service also sends updates to Kafka on the
topic-responder-command when missions are completed to indicate that the
Responder is available for a new mission.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Send: topic-mission-event, topic-responder-command</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Receive: topic-mission-command, topic-responder-location-update</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process-service">Process Service</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Spring Boot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Process Automation Manager (PAM)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Decision Manager (DM)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Components: Postgres DB</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Process Service is responsible for managing the overall process flow
of the system. The Process Service operates purely on Kafka messages and
does not expose any HTTP API - although it does invoke HTTP APIs in the
Responder and Incident Priority Services.</p>

<p>When a new Incident is reported on the topic-incident-event Topic, the
process Service kicks off a new BPM process to manage the new Incident.
When a Responder is shown as available (via the topic-responder-event
Topic), the BPM process is updated to reflect this. As the Mission
progresses and additional messages are received on the
topic-mission-event Topic, the BPM process is updated to reflect the
latest state.</p>

<p>The Process Service sends out multiple types of messages on various
Topics in response to the Incident progressing through the Business
Process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Send: topic-mission-command, topic-responder-command,
topic-incident-command, topic-incident-event</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Receive: topic-incident-event, topic-responder-event,
topic-mission-event</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incident-service">Incident Service</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Spring Boot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Products / Components: AMQ-Streams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Components: Postgres DB</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Incident Service exposes an API for registering new Incidents and
retrieving information about existing Incidents. An endpoint is also
exposed for resetting Incident state (this is typically used by
simulator services for managing and resetting the demo).</p>

<p>When a new Incident is received, the Incident details are stored in the
database and a new message is sent out on the topic-incident-event Kafka
Topic.</p>

<p>The Service also listens on Kafka to the topic topic-incident-command
for updates to Incidents and stores the latest Incident state in the
Database.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Send: topic-incident-event</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen: topic-incident-command</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="responder-service">Responder Service</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Spring Boot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Products / Components: AMQ-Streams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Components: Postgres DB</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Responder Service exposes an API for managing Responders, including
registering new Responders, retrieving information about all available
responders and retrieving information about specific responders.
Endpoints are also exposed for removing responders and resetting
responder state (these are typically used by simulator services for
managing and resetting the demo).</p>

<p>When a new Responder is registered, the Responder details are stored in
the database.</p>

<p>The Service also listens on Kafka to the topic test-topic for updates to
Responders and stores the latest Responder state in the Database. If the
update to the responder includes an Incident Id (i.e. if the responder
has been assigned to work on an Incident) the services also sends a new
Kafka message to the topic test-topic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Send: test-topic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen: test-topic</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emergency-web-console">Emergency Web Console</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Node.js, Angular</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Products / Components: None</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The emergency console is the front end UI for the Demo Solution. It
provides the following main views:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Incident Commander Dashboard: The overall view of all Incidents,
Responders and Missions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responder Interface: The view for an individual responder which
shows their current mission, including the router to the Incident
and onward route to the shelter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidents: A tabular list of all incidents</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The console communicates with several of the back end services
(Incident, Mission &amp; Responder) to display real time data via
WebSockets.</p>

<h1 id="demo-simulators">Demo Simulators</h1>

<p>The following components are used to control the demo and simulate
events which are needed for the demo, but which can not be sourced from
/ represented in the real world (i.e. Incidents, Responder Bots,
Responder movement around the map).</p>

<h2 id="responder-simulator">Responder Simulator</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Vert.x</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Components: None</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Components: None</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Responder Simulator is responsible for moving responders (both bots
and humans) around the map during missions. As the demo requires the
movement of personnel to function and since we can not have real people
actually moving many miles for each Mission, this simulator is required
to allow the demo to function.</p>

<p>The Responder simulator listens on the topic-mission-event for details
of active responders that need to be moved on the map. The simulator
them periodically updates (default every 10 seconds) the responders
location (based on the mission route received) to show the responder at
the next location. As the simulator moves responders, it emits messages
on the topic-responder-location-update Topic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Send: topic-mission-event</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Receive: topic-responder-location-update</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disaster-simulator">Disaster Simulator</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Runtime: Vert.x</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Middleware Components: None</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Components: None</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Disaster Simulator is used for managing / coordinating the demo. It
exposes a basic UI which allows a user to add and remove Incidents and
Responders in order to drive the demo forward.</p>

<p><img src="/modules/02_App_Overview/images/create-incidents.png" alt="create incidents" /></p>

<p>The Disaster Simulator uses HTTP API requests to the Incident Service,
the Responder Service the Mission Service and the Incident Priority
Service in order to manage data creation / deletion.</p>

<h1 id="process-automation">Process Automation</h1>

<p>The Process Service is responsible for managing the overall process flow
of the system. The Process Service operates purely on Kafka messages and
does not expose any HTTP API - although it does invoke HTTP APIs in the
Responder and Incident Priority Services.</p>

<p>When a new Incident is reported on the topic-incident-event Topic, the
process Service kicks off a new BPM process to manage the new Incident.
When a Responder is shown as available (via the topic-responder-event
Topic), the BPM process is updated to reflect this. As the Mission
progresses and additional messages are received on the
topic-mission-event Topic, the BPM process is updated to reflect the
latest state.</p>

<p>The Process Service sends out multiple types of messages on various
Topics in response to the Incident progressing through the Business
Process.</p>

<p>Let’s view the process diagram for an incident.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <strong>Dashboard</strong> link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click an Incident on the map.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the link for <strong>Process Diagram</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This will open new tab to view the Process Diagram for this
incident.</p>

        <p><img src="/modules/02_App_Overview/images/view-process-diagram.png" alt="view process diagram" /></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review the process diagram for this incident.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="clean-up">Clean Up</h1>
