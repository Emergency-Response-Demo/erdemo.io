In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused massive flooding in Southeast Texas, USA. 
The storm left a number of residents stranded and in need of rescue.
Emergency first responders were overwhelmed with the high volume
of rescue calls. A loose-knit group of volunteer boaters assisted in the
rescue effort. These volunteers explored neighborhoods seeking out
residents who needed assistance. In addition, with the support of social
media, a group of volunteers served as dispatchers to relay rescue
requests to the volunteer boaters. This group of volunteers became known
as the [**Cajun Navy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy). The
Cajun Navy has been operating in various forms since Hurricane Katrina
in 2005.

## The Solution

The Emergency Response Demo application is inspired by the Cajun Navy response from Hurricane Harvey. 
It provides an online demo that simulates the collaboration between stranded residents and volunteer responders.
In addition, it allows for your audience to participate in this simulation of rescuing their stranded neighbors.
