# 1. Introduction
The ER-Demo allows for provisioning from either source via CI/CD pipelines or from tagged binary images hosted in the Quay container image repository.

This document is a deep-dive into the former approach:  Provisioning from source using CI/CD pipelines.

# 2.  Jenkins Scripted vs Declarative Pipelines

Jenkins pipelines can be written in either a [Scripted or Declarative](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/devops-jenkins-2) approach.

The pipelines in the ER-Demo make use of the _Declarative_ approach.

# 4.  Jenkins Worker Nodes

Auto-Discovery

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration of slave images for the Kubernetes plug-in. 
With the OpenShift Sync plug-in, the Jenkins image on Jenkins start-up searches within the project that it is running, or the projects specifically listed in the plug-inâ€™s configuration for the following:

    Image streams that have the label role set to jenkins-slave.

    Image stream tags that have the annotation role set to jenkins-slave.

    ConfigMaps that have the label role set to jenkins-slave.

When it finds an image stream with the appropriate label, or image stream tag with the appropriate annotation, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins jobs to run in a pod running the container image provided by the image stream.
